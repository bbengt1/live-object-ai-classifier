"""RecognizedEntity and EntityEvent SQLAlchemy ORM models (Story P4-3.3)

Stores recurring visitor entities and their associations with events for the
Temporal Context Engine. Enables tracking of familiar faces/vehicles with
"first seen", "last seen", and visit count.

RecognizedEntity:
    - Represents a recurring visitor (person, vehicle, or unknown)
    - Stores reference embedding for similarity matching
    - Tracks occurrence count and temporal metadata

EntityEvent:
    - Junction table linking entities to their associated events
    - Stores similarity score for each match
    - Enables efficient queries for entity event history
