# Entities

Entities represent recurring subjects detected across your cameras - people, vehicles, and other recognizable objects. ArgusAI automatically identifies and tracks these subjects over time.

## Understanding Entities

### What Are Entities?

Entities are persistent records of subjects that appear in multiple events:

- **People**: Regular visitors, family members, delivery personnel
- **Vehicles**: Your car, neighbor's vehicles, delivery trucks
- **Other**: Future support for pets, packages, etc.

### How Entities Work

1. AI analyzes an event and extracts subject details
2. System checks for matching existing entities
3. If match found, event is linked to that entity
4. If no match, a new entity may be created
5. Entity history grows with each linked event

### Entity Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Type** | Entity category | Person, Vehicle |
| **Name** | Display name (if set) | "White Toyota Camry" |
| **First Seen** | When first detected | Dec 20, 2025 |
| **Last Seen** | Most recent appearance | Dec 25, 2025 |
| **Event Count** | Number of linked events | 42 |

#### Vehicle-Specific Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Color** | Vehicle color | White, Black, Silver |
| **Make** | Manufacturer | Toyota, Ford, Tesla |
| **Model** | Vehicle model | Camry, F-150, Model 3 |

## Browsing Entities

### Entity List

The main Entities page shows all recognized entities:

- **Thumbnail**: Representative image
- **Name**: Entity identifier
- **Type Badge**: Person or Vehicle
- **Event Count**: Number of appearances
- **Last Seen**: Most recent timestamp

### Filtering

Filter entities using:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Type** | All, Person, Vehicle |
| **Sort By** | Last Seen, First Seen, Event Count, Name |
| **Search** | Text search in entity names |

### Entity Cards

Each entity card shows:

- Primary thumbnail from recent event
- Entity name or auto-generated label
- Type indicator (person/vehicle icon)
- Quick stats (events, last seen)

## Entity Details

### Viewing an Entity

Click any entity to see full details:

#### Overview Section
- Large representative image
- Entity name and type
- All extracted attributes
- First and last seen dates
- Total event count

#### Timeline Section
- Chronological list of all linked events
- Event thumbnails and timestamps
- Camera location for each appearance
- Click events to view details

#### Activity Pattern
- Visual representation of when entity appears
- Time-of-day distribution
- Day-of-week patterns
- Helps identify regular visitors

### Editing Entity Details

Customize entity information:

1. Click **Edit** on the entity detail page
2. Modify:
   - **Name**: Give a friendly name
   - **Notes**: Add personal notes
3. Click **Save**

## Managing Event Links

### Why Manage Links?

AI matching isn't perfect. You may need to:

- Remove incorrectly linked events
- Add events that should be linked
- Merge duplicate entities

### Unlinking Events

Remove an event from an entity:

1. Open the entity detail page
2. Find the incorrect event in the timeline
3. Click the **Unlink** (X) button
4. Event is removed from entity

The event remains in the system, just unlinked from this entity.

### Linking Events

Add an unlinked event to an entity:

1. Open the event you want to link
2. Click **Add to Entity**
3. Search for the correct entity
4. Select the entity from results
5. Event is linked immediately

### Merging Entities

Combine duplicate entities:

1. Go to the Entities page
2. Select entities to merge (checkboxes)
3. Click **Merge Selected**
4. Choose which entity to keep as primary
5. Confirm the merge

After merging:
- All events from both entities are combined
- The non-primary entity is deleted
- Attributes are merged (primary takes precedence)

:::caution
Entity merges cannot be undone. Review carefully before confirming.

## Entity Alerts

Create notifications for specific entities:

1. Open entity detail page
2. Click **Create Alert Rule**
3. Configure notification settings:
   - **Notification Type**: Push, Webhook
   - **Schedule**: When to alert
   - **Cooldown**: Minimum time between alerts
4. Save the rule

Now you'll be notified when that specific entity is detected.

### Alert Use Cases

- Know when your car leaves/returns
- Track when a specific delivery person arrives
- Monitor for unfamiliar vehicles
- Get notified of repeat visitors

## Learning from Corrections

ArgusAI learns from your manual corrections:

### How Learning Works

| Action | What System Learns |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Unlink event** | These features don't match this entity |
| **Link event** | These features do match this entity |
| **Merge entities** | These variations represent the same subject |

### Improving Accuracy

To improve entity matching over time:

1. Regularly review recent entity assignments
2. Correct any obvious mistakes
3. Merge duplicate entities promptly
4. Provide clear entity names

## Tips

### Naming Entities

Good names help you identify entities quickly:

| Type | Good Names | Avoid |
|------|------------|-------|
| Vehicles | "White Toyota Camry", "Amazon Van" | "Car 1", "Unknown" |
| People | "Mail Carrier", "Neighbor John" | "Person", "Unknown Person" |

### Keeping Entities Clean

- Review entities monthly
- Merge obvious duplicates
- Delete obsolete entities
- Archive entities for subjects that no longer appear

### Privacy Considerations

- Entity data is stored locally
- No facial recognition is used
- Vehicle matching based on color/make/model
- You control all entity data
