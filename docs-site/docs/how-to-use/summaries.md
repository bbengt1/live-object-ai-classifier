# Activity Summaries

Activity Summaries provide AI-generated overviews of what's happening around your home, helping you quickly understand patterns and notable events without reviewing every individual alert.

## Understanding Summaries

### What Are Summaries?

Summaries are natural language reports generated by AI that analyze your event history and describe:

- **Daily activity overview**: What happened throughout the day
- **Notable patterns**: Recurring visitors, regular deliveries
- **Unusual activity**: Anything out of the ordinary
- **Key events**: Important moments highlighted

### How Summaries Work

1. At scheduled intervals, ArgusAI collects recent events
2. AI analyzes the events collectively
3. A human-readable summary is generated
4. The summary is stored and displayed

## Viewing Summaries

## Summary Types

| **Afternoon** | Midday activity (12 PM - 6 PM) |
| **Evening** | Later activity (6 PM - 10 PM) |
| **Night** | Overnight activity (10 PM - 6 AM) |

Example daily summary:

> **December 25, 2025**
>
> Today was relatively quiet with 12 events detected. The morning started with the usual mail delivery at 10:15 AM, followed by several package deliveries throughout the afternoon. A white Toyota Camry (recognized as a recurring visitor) arrived at 2:30 PM and departed at 4:15 PM. No unusual activity detected overnight.

## Providing Feedback

### Rating Summaries

After reading a summary:

1. Click **thumbs up** if helpful and accurate
2. Click **thumbs down** if unhelpful or inaccurate
3. Optionally add a comment explaining why

### How Feedback Helps

Your feedback improves future summaries:

| Feedback | System Learns |
|----------|---------------|
| Thumbs up | This style/content is valuable |
| Thumbs down | This approach needs improvement |
| Comments | Specific areas to adjust |

Over time, summaries become more tailored to your preferences.

## Tips

### Getting Better Summaries

- Ensure cameras are properly named with locations
- Enable relevant detection types
- Review and correct entity assignments
- Provide feedback on generated summaries

### Using Summaries Effectively

- Review daily summaries each morning
- Use weekly summaries for pattern recognition
- Share summaries with family members
- Reference summaries when reviewing past events

### Summary Limitations

- Summaries reflect detected events only
- Missed detections won't appear
- AI interpretation may not always be perfect
- Complex scenarios may be oversimplified

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **No summaries generating** | Check AI provider is configured |
| **Summary too brief** | Ensure events are being detected |
| **Inaccurate summary** | Review and correct entity data |
| **Missing time periods** | Check camera coverage for gaps |
