# Project Backlog

Technical debt, improvements, and future work items identified during development.

## Priority Legend
- **P1**: Critical - blocks other work
- **P2**: High - should be addressed soon
- **P3**: Medium - address when convenient
- **P4**: Low - nice to have

## Technical Debt

| ID | Date | Priority | Type | Description | Source | Status |
|----|------|----------|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| TD-001 | 2025-12-06 | P2 | Infrastructure | **Set up frontend testing framework** - Frontend has no Jest, Vitest, or React Testing Library configured. All frontend component tests are currently blocked. Should be addressed at end of Epic P3-3 or start of next phase. Recommended: Vitest + React Testing Library for consistency with modern React patterns. | Story P3-3.4 Code Review | Done |

## Improvements

| ID | Date | Priority | Type | Description | Source | Status |
|----|------|----------|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| IMP-001 | 2025-12-06 | P4 | Code Quality | Remove console.log debug statements from EventCard.tsx (lines 104, 107) before production deployment | Story P3-3.4 Code Review | Open |

## Future Features

| ID | Date | Priority | Type | Description | Source | Status |
|----|------|----------|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| FF-001 | 2025-12-08 | P3 | Troubleshooting | **Log Viewer UI** - Simple dashboard page to view and download logs for troubleshooting. Features: (1) View last 24 hours of backend logs, (2) Filter by log level (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG), (3) Search/filter by text, (4) Download logs as file, (5) Auto-refresh option. Implementation: Store logs in SQLite or file rotation, add /api/v1/system/logs endpoint, build React component in Settings page. | User Request | Open |
| FF-002 | 2025-12-08 | P2 | UX | **Events Page Real-time Updates** - Add refresh capability to events page so new events appear without manual page reload. Options: (1) Manual refresh button with loading indicator, (2) WebSocket subscription to EVENT_CREATED messages (backend already broadcasts these), (3) Auto-refresh toggle with configurable interval. Recommended: Use existing WebSocket infrastructure - subscribe to EVENT_CREATED and prepend new events to list. | User Request | Open |
| FF-003 | 2025-12-08 | P2 | UX | **Show Camera Name on Event Cards** - Event cards currently display camera_id (UUID) instead of the human-readable camera name. Update EventCard component to show camera.name for better identification. Backend API already includes camera_name in EVENT_CREATED WebSocket messages and event responses - just need to use it in the frontend display. | User Request | Open |
| FF-004 | 2025-12-08 | P2 | Performance | **Move Camera Preview to Cameras Page** - Dashboard currently shows live camera previews which generates significant network traffic (frame polling). Move the live preview grid to the Cameras page instead. Dashboard should show only camera status info (name, online/offline, last event) without live video streams. This reduces API chatter when users are just viewing the main dashboard. | User Request | Open |
| FF-005 | 2025-12-08 | P3 | UX | **Mobile Navigation - Top Bar Only** - On mobile devices, show navigation only at the top of the page instead of sidebar. Hide the sidebar on small screens and use a hamburger menu or horizontal nav bar to clean up the interface and maximize content area. Use Tailwind responsive breakpoints (md:hidden, lg:block) to toggle between mobile top nav and desktop sidebar. | User Request | Open |
| FF-006 | 2025-12-08 | P2 | UX | **Dashboard Real-time Stats Update** - When a new event is created, update the "Total Events" and "Current Activity" cards on the dashboard in real-time. Subscribe to EVENT_CREATED WebSocket messages and increment counters without requiring page refresh. Can be implemented alongside FF-002 (Events Page Real-time Updates) using same WebSocket subscription pattern. | User Request | Open |
| BUG-001 | 2025-12-08 | P2 | Bug | **Export JSON/CSV Buttons Failing** - The export buttons on the events page are not working. Investigate and fix the /api/v1/events/export endpoint or frontend export functionality. Check: (1) API endpoint returning correct data format, (2) Frontend correctly calling export endpoint, (3) File download handling in browser. | User Report | Open |
| BUG-002 | 2025-12-08 | P3 | Bug | **Motion Events Not Captured from Protect** - Pure motion events (without smart detection) are not being captured. Investigation shows that `is_motion_currently_detected` flag is separate from `is_smart_detected` in Protect WebSocket. When smart detection occurs (person/vehicle), motion flag is False. Options: (1) Treat smart detections AS motion events (they all involve motion), (2) Add separate motion event polling, (3) Accept that smart detections are the primary event type and update camera config UI to clarify this. Note: This may be expected behavior - Protect prioritizes smart detection over raw motion. | Investigation | Open |
| FF-007 | 2025-12-08 | P3 | Feature | **Selective Backup/Restore Options** - Add granular selection for both backup and restore operations. Backup: Allow users to choose which components to include via checkboxes: (1) Database (events, cameras, alert rules), (2) Thumbnails/media files, (3) System settings, (4) AI provider configuration (API keys), (5) Protect controller config. Restore: Parse backup file to show available components, let user select which parts to restore (e.g., restore only settings without overwriting events). | User Request | Open |
| FF-008 | 2025-12-08 | P2 | DevOps | **Installation Script & Setup Wizard** - Create executable install script to automate application setup. Script should: (1) Check/install Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, (2) Create virtual environment and install backend dependencies, (3) Install frontend dependencies and build, (4) Initialize database with migrations, (5) Generate encryption key, (6) Create systemd/launchd service files, (7) Configure reverse proxy (nginx) template. Manual setup items to document: (a) AI provider API keys (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok), (b) UniFi Protect controller credentials, (c) RTSP camera URLs and credentials, (d) SSL certificates for HTTPS, (e) Firewall/port forwarding for remote access. Include first-run setup wizard in UI for manual config items. | User Request | Open |

## Notes

- Items are added during code reviews, retrospectives, and development
- Priority should be reassessed during sprint planning
- Status: Open, In Progress, Done, Won't Fix
