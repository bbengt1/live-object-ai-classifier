# Story P9-4.5: Implement Entity Merge

Status: ready-for-review

## Story

As a user managing entities,
I want to merge duplicate entities together,
so that the same person/vehicle isn't split across multiple entities and I have accurate entity histories.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-4.5.1:** Given entities list, when viewing, then checkboxes for multi-select are available
2. **AC-4.5.2:** Given two entities selected, when viewing, then "Merge" button is enabled
3. **AC-4.5.3:** Given I click Merge, when dialog opens, then shows both entities with event counts
4. **AC-4.5.4:** Given merge dialog, when viewing, then can choose which entity to keep
5. **AC-4.5.5:** Given I confirm merge, when complete, then all events moved to primary entity
6. **AC-4.5.6:** Given I confirm merge, when complete, then secondary entity deleted
7. **AC-4.5.7:** Given I confirm merge, when complete, then toast "Entities merged successfully"
8. **AC-4.5.8:** Given merge with 50 events, when complete, then operation succeeds (performance)

## Dev Notes

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story P9-4.4 (Status: done)**

- **EntityAdjustment Model**: Already tracks manual corrections with action types "assign", "move_from", "move_to", "unlink"
- **Entity Service Methods**: `unlink_event()` and `assign_event()` established patterns for entity operations
- **Occurrence Count Updates**: Pattern established - increment/decrement occurrence_count when events are linked/unlinked
- **Query Invalidation**: Invalidate entity list, entity detail, and entity events queries on mutations
- **EntitySelectModal**: Modal component pattern for entity selection UI
- **API Pattern**: POST /api/v1/context/events/{event_id}/entity - follow similar pattern for merge

[Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/p9-4-4-implement-event-entity-assignment.md#Dev-Agent-Record]

**From Story P9-4.3 (Status: done)**

- **DELETE Endpoint Pattern**: DELETE /api/v1/context/entities/{entity_id}/events/{event_id}
- **AlertDialog Pattern**: Radix AlertDialog for confirmation dialogs
- **Transaction Pattern**: Entity operations should be atomic

[Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/p9-4-3-implement-event-entity-unlinking.md]

### Architecture Notes

**Merge API Design:**
```
POST /api/v1/context/entities/merge
{
  "primary_entity_id": "uuid",   // Entity to keep
  "secondary_entity_id": "uuid"  // Entity to merge into primary and delete
}

Response: {
  "success": true,
  "merged_entity_id": "uuid",
  "events_moved": 15,
  "deleted_entity_id": "uuid",
  "message": "Entities merged successfully"
}
```

**EntityAdjustment Records for Merge:**
For each event moved from secondary to primary:
```python
EntityAdjustment(
    event_id=event.id,
    old_entity_id=secondary_entity_id,
    new_entity_id=primary_entity_id,
    action="merge",
    event_description=event.description
)
```

**Database Transaction Flow:**
```python
async with db.begin():
    # 1. Get all events linked to secondary entity
    # 2. Update each event's entity_id to primary
    # 3. Create EntityAdjustment record for each event
    # 4. Update primary.occurrence_count += secondary.occurrence_count
    # 5. Delete secondary entity
```

**UI Selection State:**
```typescript
const [selectedEntityIds, setSelectedEntityIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const canMerge = selectedEntityIds.size === 2;
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Backend Files:**
- API endpoint: `backend/app/api/v1/context.py` (add merge endpoint)
- Service: `backend/app/services/entity_service.py` (add merge_entities method)
- Model: `backend/app/models/entity_adjustment.py` (supports "merge" action)
- Schema: `backend/app/schemas/entity.py` (add merge request/response schemas)

**Frontend Files:**
- New Component: `frontend/components/entities/EntityMergeDialog.tsx` (NEW)
- Hook: `frontend/hooks/useEntities.ts` (add useMergeEntities)
- Page: `frontend/app/entities/page.tsx` (add selection state and merge button)
- EntityCard: May need checkbox and selected state

### Performance Considerations

- Merge with many events (50+): Use bulk update query rather than individual updates
- Transaction isolation: Ensure no events are linked during merge operation
- Query invalidation: May trigger refetch of large entity lists
