## Glossary

**Terms used throughout architecture:**

- **Event:** A detected occurrence (motion + AI analysis result)
- **Alert:** Notification triggered by event matching rule
- **Rule:** User-defined conditions that trigger alerts
- **Webhook:** HTTP POST sent to external URL when alert triggers
- **Thumbnail:** Small JPEG image captured during event (~200KB)
- **Confidence:** AI model's certainty score (0-100%)
- **Cooldown:** Time period where duplicate alerts suppressed
- **RTSP:** Real-Time Streaming Protocol (camera feed standard)
- **Motion Detection:** Algorithm to identify movement in frames
- **Background Subtraction:** Technique to detect motion by comparing frames
- **JWT:** JSON Web Token (authentication token format)
- **ORM:** Object-Relational Mapping (database abstraction)
- **Async:** Asynchronous programming (non-blocking I/O)
- **Server Component:** React component that renders on server
- **Client Component:** React component that renders in browser

## Next Steps

**After architecture approval:**

1. **Sprint Planning:** Break into implementable stories (4-8 hour chunks)
2. **Story Prioritization:** Backend core → Frontend dashboard → Integration
3. **Environment Setup:** Initialize repos with starters
4. **Database Migrations:** Create initial schema with Alembic
5. **Implementation:** Follow epic order from PRD

**First Sprint Stories (Example):**
1. Initialize frontend with Next.js starter
2. Initialize backend with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
3. Create database models (cameras, events, alert_rules)
4. Implement camera CRUD API endpoints
5. Implement camera service (RTSP capture)
6. Implement motion detection service
7. Build camera management UI

**Architecture validation checklist:**

- ✅ All PRD functional requirements have architectural support
- ✅ All PRD non-functional requirements addressed (performance, security, usability)
- ✅ Technology stack versions specified and verified as current
- ✅ Project structure complete with all necessary directories
- ✅ Database schema supports all features with proper relationships
- ✅ API contracts defined for all endpoints
- ✅ Implementation patterns documented for consistency
- ✅ Security considerations addressed (auth, encryption, validation)
- ✅ Performance optimizations identified for critical paths
- ✅ Deployment approach defined (dev + production)
- ✅ Architectural decisions recorded with rationale
