# Next Steps

**After architecture approval:**

1. **Sprint Planning:** Break into implementable stories (4-8 hour chunks)
2. **Story Prioritization:** Backend core → Frontend dashboard → Integration
3. **Environment Setup:** Initialize repos with starters
4. **Database Migrations:** Create initial schema with Alembic
5. **Implementation:** Follow epic order from PRD

**First Sprint Stories (Example):**
1. Initialize frontend with Next.js starter
2. Initialize backend with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
3. Create database models (cameras, events, alert_rules)
4. Implement camera CRUD API endpoints
5. Implement camera service (RTSP capture)
6. Implement motion detection service
7. Build camera management UI

- ✅ All PRD functional requirements have architectural support
- ✅ All PRD non-functional requirements addressed (performance, security, usability)
- ✅ Technology stack versions specified and verified as current
- ✅ Project structure complete with all necessary directories
- ✅ Database schema supports all features with proper relationships
- ✅ API contracts defined for all endpoints
- ✅ Implementation patterns documented for consistency
- ✅ Security considerations addressed (auth, encryption, validation)
- ✅ Performance optimizations identified for critical paths
- ✅ Deployment approach defined (dev + production)
- ✅ Architectural decisions recorded with rationale
