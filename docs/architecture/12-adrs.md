## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture

**Decision:** Use motion detection as trigger for AI processing, not continuous analysis.

**Rationale:**
- Cost: AI API calls expensive, motion-triggered reduces calls by 95%+
- Performance: System can process 2+ events/day per camera vs continuous strain
- Privacy: Only analyze when motion detected, not 24/7 recording

**Trade-offs:**
- May miss very slow-moving objects
- Depends on motion detection accuracy
- Requires tuning motion sensitivity

**Status:** Accepted

### ADR-002: Description Storage vs Video Storage

**Decision:** Store AI-generated descriptions and thumbnails, not video footage.

**Rationale:**
- Storage: 1 event = ~50KB vs 1 minute video = 10MB (200x smaller)
- Privacy: Descriptions less sensitive than video, easier GDPR compliance
- Searchability: Natural language searchable, video is not
- Accessibility: Descriptions readable by screen readers

**Trade-offs:**
- Cannot review full video context after the fact
- Description quality depends on AI model accuracy
- Single frame may miss context

**Status:** Accepted (core product philosophy)

### ADR-003: SQLite for MVP Database

**Decision:** Use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL or MySQL for MVP.

**Rationale:**
- Zero setup: File-based, no server to install
- Performance: Sufficient for 10,000+ events (tested)
- Simplicity: Single file backup, easy to distribute
- Migration path: SQLAlchemy makes PostgreSQL migration easy in Phase 2

**Trade-offs:**
- No concurrent write support (acceptable for single-camera)
- Limited full-text search (can use FTS5 extension)
- No native JSON query operators (store as TEXT)

**Status:** Accepted for MVP, revisit in Phase 2

---

### ADR-004: FastAPI BackgroundTasks vs External Queue

**Decision:** Use FastAPI's BackgroundTasks for event processing, not Celery/Redis.

**Rationale:**
- Simplicity: No additional services to manage
- MVP scope: Single camera means low throughput
- Async: Python asyncio handles concurrency well
- Cost: $0 infrastructure (no Redis hosting)

**Trade-offs:**
- No persistence: Tasks lost if server crashes during processing
- No distributed processing: Can't scale across machines
- Limited monitoring: No Celery Flower equivalent

**Status:** Accepted for MVP, consider Celery in Phase 2 for multi-camera

---

### ADR-005: Multi-Provider AI with Fallback

**Decision:** Support OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude with automatic fallback.

**Rationale:**
- Reliability: One provider down doesn't break system
- Cost: Can switch to cheapest/free provider
- Quality: Can A/B test which gives best descriptions
- Flexibility: Users can choose based on ethics/preference

**Trade-offs:**
- Complexity: 3 SDK integrations instead of 1
- Testing: Must test all providers
- Inconsistency: Descriptions may vary by provider

**Status:** Accepted (key differentiator)

---

### ADR-006: Next.js App Router vs Pages Router

**Decision:** Use Next.js 15 App Router (not Pages Router).

**Rationale:**
- Future-proof: App Router is the future of Next.js
- Performance: React Server Components reduce client JS
- Layout: Better nested layout support
- Streaming: Suspense for progressive rendering

**Trade-offs:**
- Learning curve: Newer paradigm, fewer examples
- Ecosystem: Some libraries not optimized yet
- Complexity: Server/Client component distinction

**Status:** Accepted (Next.js recommendation)

---

### ADR-007: shadcn/ui vs Material-UI vs Chakra

**Decision:** Use shadcn/ui for component library.

**Rationale:**
- Ownership: Copy-paste components, full control
- Tailwind: Integrates perfectly with Tailwind CSS
- Customization: Easy to modify unlike npm packages
- Bundle size: Only include what you use

**Trade-offs:**
- Manual updates: Must copy new versions manually
- Initial setup: More components to set up initially
- No built-in themes: Must style from scratch

**Status:** Accepted (Tailwind ecosystem standard)
